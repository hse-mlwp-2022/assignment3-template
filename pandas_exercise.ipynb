    "\n",
    "1. *When you open this file on GitHub, copy the address to this file from the address bar of your browser. Now you can go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), click `File -> Open notebook -> GitHub`, paste the copied URL and click the search button (the one with the magnifying glass to the right of the search input box). Your personal copy of this notebook will now open on Google Colab.*\n",
    "2. *Do not delete or change variable names in the code cells below. You may add to each cell as many lines of code as you need, just make sure to assign your solution to the predefined variable(s) in the corresponding cell. Failing to do so will make the tests fail.*\n",
    "3. *To save your work, click `File -> Save a copy on GitHub` and __make sure to manually select the correct repository from the dropdown list__.*\n",
    "4. *If you mess up with this file and need to start from scratch, you can always find the original one [here](https://github.com/hse-mlwp-2022/assignment3-template/blob/main/pandas_exercise.ipynb). Just open it in Google Colab (see note 1) and save to your repository (see note 3). Remember to backup your code elsewhere, since this action will overwrite your previous work.* \n",
    "5. *Exercises 1-4 are mandatory. Your work __will not be graded__ if you fail any one of them. Exercises 5-8 are optional, you can skip them if you want*\n",

    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using 2019 flight statistics from the United States Department of Transportationâ€™s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (available [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FMF&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%20Pn44vr45) and in this repository as `data/T100_MARKET_ALL_CARRIER.zip`). Each row contains information about a specific route for a given carrier in a given month (e.g., JFK &rarr; LAX on Delta Airlines in January). There are 321,409 rows and 41 columns. Note that you don't need to unzip the file to read it in with `pd.read_csv()`.\n",
